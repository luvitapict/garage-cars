Cat gets stuck in garage door after falling asleep From aol.com
This kit is specifically for lockout cases where you can’t go inside your garage opening the door sectionals along the tracks. You can do this by finding the red release cold and then turning the key, and opening the door. Ensure proper support and effort as you push the heavy panels along the tracks. While if you are stuck on the outside of your garage doors and have no other means of entry to your garage, there is not much you can do aside from wait for the repair company to arrive.
